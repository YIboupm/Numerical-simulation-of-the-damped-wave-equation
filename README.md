# Numerical-simulation-of-the-damped-wave-equation
The purpose of these python codes is to simulate a one-dimensional damped or undamped wave equation using python. The separation of variables method, finite element method, and finite difference method are used to describe the wave behavior of different initial waveforms under different damping coefficients.
